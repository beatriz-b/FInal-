# Escape Room 

## Overview
A text based game that where the user will have to escape a locked room. The setting will be a familiar, possibly the 
classroom/lab room we all learn in. The room will be desribed to each player and from the description the player will have choices such as 'search' or 'break' or 'push'. Items and important information will be stored in their 'Items' menu that can be pulled up at teh press of a button. 

## Background
A couple months in a beginners C++ programming class. I've also participated in a phyisical escape room once but have played games where you have to escape rooms numerous times. 

## Significance
This project stresses the importance of stored sequence of events in memory. This program will work as an exercise to inhance the memory and mental capabilities of the user. 

## Deliverables

Fleshing out the steps 

#### The Rooms 
      1. being texted based I will need to have a clear and concises description of the room that includes the items in the room and maybe listing the possible ways that the user would be able to interact with them. 
      2. The room should change dynamically, meaning that if something is removed from the room then it shuold not be in the rooms description anymore. 
      3. There should be a dialouge that follows every interaction of the objects you can have with the room.
      (optional possible) If i can use backsplashes and haave a whole picture of a room displayed then I will base my items and the story on what ever is in the room. 
      4. I will have a list of possible interaction with the room that the person can choose forom (like Outer Worlds) and make it loop around without it seeming like its looping around (Like outer worlds) 
     
##### Invetory 
      1. inventory will be stored in a list that the user can pull up and view by pressing a command. 
      2. The items will be in a list (1 through > ) the user will be able to press the corresponding number on  the key board to get the information of the items. (with the description I could write its hints ex. this key is the same color as the door knob in this room) 
      3. Once the item has been used then it should be either removed from inventory or marked as unusable. 
      
      
##### Hints (if implemented) 
      1. Hints will be accessed with a by pressing a command on the keyboard. 
      2. One hint should appear when pressed and should be appropriatly alined with the progresses the user has made ingame. 
      
##### Save file 
      1. Keeps track of the items and saves tehm in teh inventory (if used, if not used, if discovered at all) 
      
##### The apperance 
      1. There shold be an introduction, that mentions a button the user can press to pull up a list of commands.
        a. Commands such as 
            i. What is in my inventory 
            ii. What button do i press to get hints

### Skeleton
  1.Outline of the story, the journey of how the player gets stuck in the room and how they will be let out.
### Basic
  1. The interactions with objects are correct and time appropriate. 
  1. hints 
### Solid
  1. items, inventory 
### Awesome
  1. Saves files that keep the progress of the player. 
### Beyond
  1. Have a timer to complete the game.
  2. DIfferent difficulties. 
  3. Implement minigames like tic tac toe, and rock paper scissors that act as stages you need to pass to move on. 

## Tools
### C++ 
A general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. (source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). I will also be using 9th edition of text book Starting Out with C++ by Tony Gaddis.

## Possible Problems
The size of the program will make it very difficult to debug. Also how to implement each stage in proper order and make sure enough hints are provided to the player to make sure they know what direction to go in. Additional problems will include the writing of the story, making sure there is enough time allocated outside of class and also that its cohesive and makes sense. Also, creating a save file to keep track on invetory.
